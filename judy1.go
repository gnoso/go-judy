// Go language wrapper for Judy arrays (as found at http://judy.sourceforge.net)
//
// Judy arrays are a fast and memory efficient dynamic array structure. Judy arrays were invented by Doug Baskins
// and implemented by Hewlett-Packard.
//
// Judy is designed to avoid cache-line fills wherever possible. There are several different variants of Judy
// arrays. This package implements the Judy1 bitvector and the JudyL integer map currently. Adding other
// variants should be relatively simple, however.
//
// Counting and range counting operations are particularly fast, and do not require a scan of the array.

// A Judy1 array is the equivalent of a bit array or bit map. A bit is addressed by an index (key). The array may be sparse, and the index is a uint64 value. If an index is present, it represents a set bit (a bit set represents an index present). If an index is absent, it represents an unset bit (a bit unset represents an absent index).
// The default value of this struct is a valid empty Judy1 array.
//
//    j := Judy1{}
//    defer j.Free()
//
//    j.Set(5142)
//    fmt.Printf("Number of items: %v", j.CountAll())
//
//
// Memory to support the array is allocated as bits are set, and released as bits are unset. If the Judy1 array is freed ( by calling .Free() ), all bits are unset (and the Judy1 array requires no memory).
// As with an ordinary array, a Judy1 array contains no duplicate indexes.
//
// NOTE: The Judy array is implemented in C and allocates memory directly from the operating system. It is NOT
// garbage collected by the Go runtime. It is very important that you call Free() on a Judy array after using
// it to prevent memory leaks. The "defer" pattern is a great way to accomplish this.
